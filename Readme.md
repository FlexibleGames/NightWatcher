# The Nightwatcher
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/nightwatcher

## A Super ScareCrow
When placed this block prevents Drifter (and/or Wolf) spawns in a radius around it.

The effected radius is configurable, look for 'watcher_config.json' in the ModConfig directory once you load the game with the mod. Default radius is 64. Also set what mobs are blocked in the config. 

**!!IMPORTANT!!** 

While ever vigilant, the blocking effect does not work during temporal storms.

This is not meant to be craftable in the early game. You need to spend some time afraid of the dark before you can appreciate safety. 

Pick up the Nightwatcher with Shift+Right Click
